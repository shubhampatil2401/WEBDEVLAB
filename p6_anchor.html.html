    <h1 id="Lin">Linkedin</h1>
    <p>
     The best part? Publishing on the platform is completely free. You don’t have to buy a domain name, pay for ads or anything else to boost your exposure – all you need to do is sign up for an account and start sharing content and making connections.<br>

     LinkedIn users are always looking for more information related to their industry or niche, so you have the opportunity to show them what you know and position yourself as an authority in your field.<br>
     LinkedIn is all about building relationships, and you can build strong and meaningful ones by providing your connections with real value. You can build credibility and trust and connect with other bloggers in your niche, opening the doors to more opportunities for growing your business.<br>

     Now, you can publish content directly on LinkedIn just like you do on your blogging platform, but you can also share your blog posts. This means that you can use LinkedIn to increase lead generating traffic to your blog.<br>

     You can attract a lot of people interested in what you have to say and, after reading a few high-quality articles on the platform, they will be compelled to check out your blog and learn more about you. Whenever you publish a new article, your connections will receive a notification, so they will never miss out on your awesome content.<br>

     Also, on LinkedIn, sharing is caring. Your connections will share your articles with their audience if they find them relevant and interesting, helping you expand your reach even more. Then, their connections will read and share them and head to your blog as well. This is why using LinkedIn as a blogging platform is an opportunity you definitely shouldn’t miss.

    <h1 id="git">Github</h1>  
    <p>
        GitHub is an online platform for hosting the code. It supports version controlling, keeping track of changes made by developers, and collaboration.<br>

        It is an American company. Development of the GitHub.com platform started on October 19, 2007. The site was launched in April 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett, and Scott Chacon. which hosts the source code of our project in any of the programming languages and keeps track of the various changes made by a developer. GitHub on the web gives us the backup of what we have done, allowing us to collaborate with others and to publish what we have done to share it with the outside world.<br>
        
        GitHub is an online Git repository hosting service, which provides a web-based graphical interface, that allows us to synchronize our source code/project store locally into the web. We can also use GitHub to browse other people’s repositories and download code or documents hassle-free. GitHub offers its basic services free of charge. It allows us to create a public or private repository, where the public will be available over the internet to the world and private is limited and only viewable by the repository owner.
